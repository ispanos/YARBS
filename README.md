# Yiannis' Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts (YARBS)

For a detailed description see [Luke's repo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS).
This is a fork created on December 20, 2018.

This script installs most of [the programs I use](https://github.com/ispanos/YARBS/blob/master/progs.csv) and deploys my config files on my
other repo [dotfiles](https://github.com/ispanos/dotfiles) - Short for Yiannis' Arch Rice.
If you like it I suggest you use the original script, which has better documentation, or fork it and make 
your own.

If I don't completely destroy the script, I will try to add some of the
original documentation.
